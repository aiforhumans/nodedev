QUICK START GUIDE
================================================================

To Use a Fully Wired Workflow:
  1. Open ComfyUI
  2. Load -> workflows/ -> select .json
  3. Adjust LM Studio server settings if needed
  4. Queue prompt to generate

To Auto-Wire Templates:
  1. Use WorkflowRequest node to describe goal
  2. Run through WorkflowGenerator
  3. Enable auto_layout=true and synthesize_links=true
  4. Run Validator to check structure
  5. Export completed workflow

For Learning:
  - Study: chain_of_thought_reasoning.json
  - Explore: prompt_engineering_showcase.json
  - Reference: complete_lm_pipeline.json

RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================

For Production Use:
  - Start with chain_of_thought_reasoning.json (clean, complete)
  - Or simple_few_shot_example.json (minimal dependencies)
  - Run all 51 unit tests before deploying changes
  - Validate workflows before loading in ComfyUI

For Development:
  - Use templates as rapid prototyping starting points
  - Enable auto_layout + synthesize_links for auto-wiring
  - Run through validator + exporter for cleanup
  - Reference prompt_engineering_showcase.json for best practices

For Learning:
  - Study chain_of_thought_reasoning.json for architecture
  - Review prompt_engineering_showcase.json for all techniques
  - Trace meta_workflow_generator.json for meta-workflows
  - Check workflows/README.md for detailed documentation
